                <h2>Why People Use TripAdvisor</h2>
                <p>Trip Advisor is a unique, timely, populist resource with both reviews and photographs posted by travelers. <br>
                    Trip Advisor enables a variety of opinions to be voiced. <br>
                    Functionality has been added so users can now book hotels, flights, vacation rentals, restaurants and directly from the site. Hotel managers have the option to respond to reviews, good and bad.</p>

                    <h3>NISHANT MALIK</h3>
                    <p>All good Indian stories start with a queen. In the princely days before Independence, Kovalam’s story starred a quiet fishing beach, an un- assuming maharani (queen) who found the area pleasing and a clifftop palace built for her to while away the monsoon. Years later, locals followed the queen’s lead, with picnics, and hippies weren’t far behind. Now paths run through palm-tree groves to guesthouses, beach- front restaurants serve up the morning haul and beach-umbrella wallahs offer shade and lounge chairs.</p>

                    <h3>MILOARD PICASSO</h3>
                    <p>In France, cheese is life. A commendable reason to visit in itself (yes, cheese tourism is a real thing) adding a little (okay, more than a little) fromage to your picnic basket is standard practice. Instead of sticking to well-known favourites you can get at home (no offence to brie and camembert) use your picnic as an opportunity to taste a little from the different regions of France. While bread and cheese is great, you’d be wise to balance out your picnic basket with some lighter bites.</p>

                    <h3>FELICE DA VINCI</h3>
                    <p>There’s no need to rush your visit to Zurich, Switzerland. Take a short day trip to this picturesque waterfront city of Zurich, and spend your time relaxing by the lake or perusing one of its many museums. If you want to spend your day learning the country’s history, then check out the Swiss National Museum. This is a collection of three museums — the National Museum Zurich, the Forum of Swiss History Schwyz, and the Collections Center.</p>
